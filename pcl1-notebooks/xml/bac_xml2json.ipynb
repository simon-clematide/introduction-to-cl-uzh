Mike Kosterlitz , Richard Stewardson and I left England on Friday evening 2iS June 1968 , and reached the Val Bregaglia at dusk on Saturday . For three days the weather was perfect , and onednesday . Mike and I were prostrate by Lake C' omo after doing the Northwest ridge of the Sciora di Fuori and the North ridge of the Piz C' engalo ( the latter a superb slab and groove climb on perfect rock ) . We had also reconnoitred the route which was my main ambition for the summer , the unrepeated C' orti-Battaglia route on the Piz Hadilc .\"}\n",
      "{\"text\": \"This climb lies on the big pillar forming the left hand part of the Hadile 's familiar Northeast face . It was first climbed in 1953 and the only facts on record are that the climbing was largely artificial and the unfortunate Hattaglia was struck by lightning on the summit and killed . The face has several cracks and from the Sciora hut it is not clear which is the best line of weakness . Hut we had had a grandstand view of the upper two-thirds of the face from the C' engalo 's North ridge [ 2 ] and we were m no doubt what must be the line . It was a beautiful S-bend crack , slanting slightly to the right , steep at the bottom , easing in the middle , and rearing up at the top to end in a long , straight groove capped by a roof . It reminded us of the Great Wall on C'logwyn du'r Arddu .\"}\n",
      "{\"text\": \"However , unlike Cloggy 's Ivast Buttress , this face is guarded by a steep snow and ice couloir with an obviously difficult bergschrund . During our day on the C' engalo nothing fell down the couloir ; nevertheless its lower section looked unpleasant . In contrast the upper part was quite amiable and we thought of approaching from the Italian side and descending from the col between the Badile and C' engalo . This would probably be as long as the approach from the Sciora hut though less difficult , but its chief advantage was brought home tous late that same afternoon , as after descending from the Cengalo , we waded through knee-deep snow to the Passo di Bondo on our return to Switzerland . Neither of us wanted to repeat that .\"}\n",
      "{\"text\": \"So when the joys of C' omo began to pall and our wallets to grow thin , instead of returning to Bondo we drove up the \\\\ al Masino to the road end and tackled the 1400 m of ascent to the Gianetti hut . The guardian , Fiorelli , was suitably impressed when we mentioned the C' orti route and told us that it was ' estremamente difficile ' , ' tutto chiodi ' , and that it needed lots of ' cunei di legno ' . Privately , we thought we knew better 혰 after all , it was less than vertical , so some of it must be tree . We never thought to ask him w here it went .\"}\n",
      "{\"text\": \"Bad weather compelled us to wait for two days , though on the second day , a Sunday , the black clouds cleared a little and several routes were done by niRETTISSIMA ON THE PIZ BADILE weekend parties . Despite our ascent of a 400 -ft Vialnglese on an outcrop below the hut , we were a bit demoralised that night . We decided to give it one more day and go on to Chamonix .\"}\n",
      "{\"text\": \"That night the sky cleared and the morning was fine . We reached the col by an easy snow slope and looking down the couloir we thought how clever we 'd been . It was fairly steep , but obviously it was only 500 ft or so to the foot of the crack line . We wrent down one at a time , kicking big steps in the hard snow . After 1000 ft we realised we 'd underestimated a little , and only after 1500 ft of descent and two hours ' effort did we reach the start . It was now a quarter to nine . Still , it was midsummer , so we hoped , to get away without a bivouac .\"}\n",
      "{\"text\": \"Mike led off up the first pitch , a steep , wide crack . He had a fair amount of d'fficulty and had to use a few pegs 혰 though he found an old ring peg in place , which was encouraging . By the time I followed , I was very cold , and the rock here was wet . A pile of curious jammed flakes supported us both , but a small block which I dislodged higher up sent them all tumbling into the couloir . Hands were numb and the climbing was hard . I grasped the old peg and almost came on the rope 혰 he had n't told me he 'd taken it out and stuck it into a clump of moss . I struggled up to the stance wondering how many days the good weather would last .\"}\n",
      "{\"text\": \"WTe exchanged loads and I went on . The lighter sack was a relief but our thirty pegs and karabiners made the leader 's load as heavy and at least as awkward as the second 's . Fortunately the climbing eased , and the next three pitches were largely scrambling . This was more encouraging 혰 our initial impressions that the lower half would be free were now being confirmed .\"}\n",
      "{\"text\": \"In fact , wre found only two more difficult pitches before the steep final section . The one I led was a pleasant corner crack , but Mike 's pitch , just below the recess in the middle of the face , was a nasty loose chimney , slanting to the right . Just above my stance he climbed over three blocks jammed abreast , then over a frightening projecting flake , and with considerable skill avoided sending down any rock until he was well out of my line . Then a barrage started 혰 boulders , gravel and Scottish oaths flew down the cliff for minutes on end . The sack seemed to be annoying him particularly . When I followed I saw his point 혰 the chimney was fine if you had nothing to carry . He hauled the big sack as he 'd cleverly hauled his own , so I was able to enjoy it , using the rubbish at the back of the chimney as a sort of treadmill .\"}\n",

      "{\"text\": \"Half-past-one 혰 my lead first . The pegs had come to seem a reasonable load by now , and it was good to use them after carrying them so far . We were able to free-climb bits of the pitch and we used several jammed nuts to save time and effort . There was no ledge so I took a stance in 챕triers and Mike led on . Oddly , the roof seemed no closer .\"}\n",
      "{\"text\": \"After 90 ft of rather loose pegging he stopped at the foot of the di챔dre . Above was a huge flake , apparently poised across the crack , and for a few minutes we thought of swinging across into one of the other cracks 혰 but these were equally loose and ledgeless . I came up , impressed by the instability of some of the pegs and the general looseness of the area where Mike was belayed , but gratified to hear that this compared to A3 climbing in Yosemite . Very cautiously I approached the big flake . From close range I could see that it was part of a really enormous block 혰 half the face 혰 and that there was no danger . It was a remarkable formation , a tongue of rock four feet deep , a foot thick at its centre , and fifteen feet long , extending across the di챔dre with daylight behind it all the way . I mantelshelfed onto it and continued .\"}\n",
      "{\"text\": \"Sadly , there was no chimney in the di챔dre as we had hoped , and not even a hand-jamming crack , so it was pegs all the way , supplemented by nuts . Again the stance was in 챕triers but the roof did seem closer 혰 40 ft , I suggested to Mike . Eighty at least was his estimate , and by now daylight was getting short . He ran out 130 ft at best Californian speed and he still was n't there . He found a ledge , the first since lunch , and suggested we 'd have to bivouac there . ' Is it big enough to cook onWait till you see it ' .\"}\n",
      "{\"text\": \"I still had hopes of reaching the shoulder , but darkness came when I was half way up the pitch . In a way it was a relief 혰 tension was reduced , we knew we 'd have to bivouac there 혰 and suddenly I felt really tired . I left three expensive pegs 혰 the first we 'd had to leave 혰 and Mike hauled me bodily onto the ledge , which seemed to be made of wet clay .\"}\n",
      "{\"text\": \"It was already very dark , but he 'd spied out the ground , such as it was . There was a long flake crack , pointing comfortingly down into the mountain and we put several pegs into this . The ' ledge ' was useless , since it was too small for two , and it was under continuous drip from the roof . We stood partly on a tiny , sloping gangway below the flake but mostly in 챕triers . I was struggling to stay DIRETTISSIMA ON THE PIZ BADII . E awake , but the fun was only beginning . We dressed up in duvets , cagoules and gloves , but long Johns seemed to be out of the question . Then we decided to move further along the flake since Mike was under a big drip . I banged another peg in and it sounded so good that I transferred both 챕triers to it . We retied the belays , hung out a pan to catch the biggest drip , and settled down under the bivouac sack .\"}\n",
      "{\"text\": \"After a few minutes we both felt very thirsty and peered out to see how much water we 'd collected . Unfortunately we both took off the sack simultaneously and it vanished , slithering wetly down the crag into the night . Suddenly it felt cold . We looked at one another , drank the water and tried to sleep again .\"}\n",
      "{\"text\": \"Although the position was very uncomfortable , I at least was so tired I could sleep . I woke to find myself falling 혰 the ' good ' peg had come out . I never came onto the belays , for after slipping only a couple of feet I was held , mostly by Mike 's hand on the back of my neck but partly , I swear , by will-power . We put a few more pegs in , doubled the belays and tried again . There were no more incidents , but the morning took a very long time to come . I slept a little , but my legs , pressed against the wet rock , were very cold . Mike was less fortunate 혰 his anorak was less waterproof , he was still under a bigger drip , and he did n't sleep at all .\"}\n",
      "{\"text\": \"At first light we began to organise ourselves , but it was a good hour before I started climbing . For one awful moment we were both entirely on one peg , which was n't even fully in , but soon I was close under the roof . Swinging on pegs placed vertically upwards is not my strongest point , so I took a lot of trouble and clipped the ropes into everything . I regretted this when I moved round the very sharp lip and found myself jammed , 15 ft short of a big ledge , in a spectacular position . I had to untie one rope and still needed all my strength to move the other . When Mike came up we saw that one of the ropes was partly severed 혰 it was proving to be an expensive route . He led the last 15 ft to the shoulder and we took off our wet duvets and lay in the sun , delighting in an almost-horizontal world .\"}\n",
      "{\"text\": \"Two big brews made from a snow patch used up our tea and sugar and reluctantly we began to climb again . There was one difficult pitch on the shoulder where a thin slab led into a bank of steep , soggy snow , but otherwise the climbing was easy . Far below we could see a party on the Cassin route , already approaching the central snow patch .\"}\n",
      "{\"text\": \"The descent was rapid although our hands , which had been wet all night , were now very painful . When we reached the hut we met Richard and Chris Wood DIRETTISSIMA OX THE PIZ BADILE who had climbed the North ridge the day before . They told us that we had done a new route 혰 something we 'd suspected , since we 'd seen no trace of Corti after the first couple of pitches of our climb . Fiorelli was engaged on his two-way radio and we gathered from snatches overheard that he was talking about us . He had been up on the Cengalo that morning and had seen us finish . On the best photo he had , he indicated that the Corti route started up our line but branched to the left fairly low down and joined a parallel crack system several hundred feet away . The reason for this was not clear to us 혰 perhaps Corti and Battaglia wrere put off by the loose chimney pitch .\"}\n",
      "{\"text\": \"We paid our bills , and set off for the valley where , it seemed , the whole world was waiting for us . We were very pleased not to have to face the Passo di Bondo again , and grateful to the builders of the excellent Gianetti hut path . When we reached the valley there was n't the battery of microphones and TV cameras we had been led to expect , but the local correspondent ofGiorno did us proud . We had free baths in the hotel at Bagni del Masino , where the water was apparently not only medicinal but radioactive , and dined in style as guests of the management . Before eating we were shown a plaster model of a mountain , recognisable as the Piz Badile only by its labels . We were asked to mark our route with a dotted line like the others . No features could be made out so we put a straight line directly up the centre of the space between the Corti route and the Cassin route .

It lies thirty-five miles south-east ot the better known Cordillera Hlanea , and is 100 miles due north of Lima . C' hicjuian , the nearest town , is only twenty-five miles from the centre of the range , and 170 miles by road from Lima via the coastal town of Paramonga . Verupaja 21,765 ft ( 6634 m ) is the highest mountain m the range , and the second highest in Peru , the highest being Huascaran 22,20^ ft ( 676 S m ) in the Cordillera Hlanea .\"}\n",
      "{\"text\": \"In November 10.66 , before news ot the current season 's attempts had reached us , I presented a report to the Wellington Section committee showing that Yerupaja had been climbed only once , by Harrah and Maxwell in 1950 , and that nine expeditions had since been unsuccessful in their attempts at a second ascent ! Harrah and Maxwell of the Harvard I'niversity team had climbed to the summit on }i July 19,^0 , along the left , or western side , of the South-west YERUPAJA TRAVERSE ridge , skirting beneath the South Summit to the col on the South ridge between the Main and South Summits . Comparing photographs published by Harrah 's expedition and our own eighteen years later , the changes in ice conditions are quite considerable . The Northwest spur which then would probably have been a steep but safe climb all the way to the North Summit , now had an ice-fall at 20,000 ft which threatens the lower part of the route . Below the South Summit , on the other hand , the large ice-fall at 20,000 ft across the southern side of which the Americans must have climbed diagonally to reach the col on the South ridge , has now vanished . I have no doubt that Harrah and Maxwell 's claim to the first ascent is entirely authentic .\"}\n",

Thus the expedition was launched and I was appointed to select and lead the team .

On the eighth day alter arrivai at Base , Hates and Brooks made a reconnaissance of the Verupaja glacier and found a suitable site for Camp 1 on the undulating ice due west of ' lam Sur at 17,200 ft. This camp was established on the fourteenth day and occupied by a team of two whose job it was to examine the approaches to the Northeast and Northwest spurs ot the North ridge . The Northeast spur was found to terminate on a steep-sided col with a very difficult approach from the snow-basin beneath the North lace . Though climbable the route to the col appeared neither practical nor sate for packing . There was , on the other hand , a good site for Camp 11 on the spacious shoulder ot the Northwest spur at 18,500 ft. On the eighteenth day a snow-cave was started at Camp I , and by the time of its occupation two days later it was approximately 25 cubic yards and easily accommodated the eight-strong team . A total of 132 man-days was spent occupying this cave and it proved most satisfactory and comfortable .\"}\n",

This was accomplished first by Barry and Dingle , who made a route up the exposed ar챗te to the face , then up diagonally to the left to regain the line of the spur . Then by Bates and Dingle , who continued the route up to Camp III , assisted on the last day by Brooks and Gallagher..Meanwhile the rest of the team were stocking Camp II , with a notable effort by Judy , who not only made more carries than the rest of us , but was always a willing volunteer when others were tired .\"}\n",
      "{\"text\": \"On 20 June , the thirty-fifth day after our arrival at Base , while Bates and Dingle were between Camps II and III , a s챕rac caused an avalanche to sweep over 700 ft of the route , removing fixed ropes and pitons . They had a miraculous escape and continued on to Camp III , crossing and recrossing the avalanche track , until they reported to me by radio from above the danger zone . At this stage I decided to abandon the Northwest spur as a route of ascent for the expedition , but as they were now at Camp III , Bates and Dingle elected to attempt the North Summit on the following day , when they reached the virgin 21,500 ft summit at 12.30 . and decided to bivouac just beneath and attempt the traverse of the North ridge to the Main Summit on the following day . After a cold and windy night it clouded by early morning , and as Dingle was showing signs of slight frost-bite they descended to spend a further night at Camp III.

Now the whole expedition was assembled at Camp II , and within half an hour a second major avalanche swept the Northwest spur . Dingle had suffered superficial trost-bite m both sets of toes , and returned to Base Camp the following day , while Brooks and Gallagher left for Camp Ilia to reconnoitre the route on the South-west ridge .\"}\n",

This job took two days to complete , and as we were using ropes to lower loads down the steep snow , it meant a lot ot standing around , and I got superficial frost-bite in both big toes . I then returned to join Dingle at Base Camp on 26 June ( forty-first day ) whilst the others stocked the new Camp Ilia above Rasac Col , and the recce team above made a route to just over 20,000 ft. On the following day Bates and Gallagher reached the 21,37s ft South Summit returning to Camp Ilia ; and two days later Bates and Gallagher , Barry and Sheppard and R. and J.

They returned to Camp IV , while Dingle and I went from Base to Camp Ha and I continued on to Camp Ilia for the evening radio contact at 6 , when we excitedly learned from Bates and Gallagher of their successful climb . I returned immediately to Camp Ha . On the following day Barry and Sheppard and R. and J. Brooks climbed to Camp IV , while Bates , Gallagher , Dingle and I occupied Camp Ilia . Whilst a more protracted summit assault would have avoided overcrowding the single mountain tent at Camp IV , it was also apparent that the weather would not hold for more than a few days , so the occupants of Camp IV gallantly sacrificed a chance of getting some sleep on the eve of their summit climb , and faced the prospect of having to go straight down to Camp Ilia when they returned .

The descent to Camp III was tedious , as no fixed ropes were placed during the first ascent twelve days before , thereafter all fixed ropes were in place but needed a lot of effort to free them from grooves they had formed in the ice .
